# NETHER MIRROR

*This game was made in a 36-hour hackathon conducted in our batch for which we won first place. Our game is based on “Reflections always follow you”. It is a fairly simple game as we had problems starting off with the game.*

The main idea of the game is that it is a platformer that moves around a terrain in the overworld and has a reflection of itself in a nether world. The main objective is to kill zombies in the nether world and get the highest possible score without dying as the zombies attack you back. While doing so, there are power-ups in the overworld which can give you boosts in the game such as a health regen powerup as well as a double damage powerup which inflicts literally double damage to the zombies. There is a distinct end to the game when you see that you can’t scroll through the map anymore.  Also, you cannot scroll back to the place where you were coming from as we felt that that would be cheating the game.

The game can be run by executing the mainGame.py file.
